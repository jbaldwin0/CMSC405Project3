This project was made based on the instructions provided in the project3.pdf file included in this repo.
The main purpose of this project was learning to use Three.js and to create a scene using the tools learned.
Setting up the project I used Vite. This project can be setup using the commands:

1. npm init @vitejs/app (using the vanilla js option
2. npm install three
3. npm run dev
